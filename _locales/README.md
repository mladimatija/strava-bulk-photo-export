# Translations

This directory follows Chrome's [extension i18n](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n) layout. Each subdirectory is one locale, named with Chrome's locale code, and contains a `messages.json` with translated strings.

`_locales/en/messages.json` is the source of truth. When you add or change a string in the source code or `manifest.json`, update `en/messages.json` first.

## Currently shipped locales

The extension ships translations for every language [Strava itself supports](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917337-Supported-Languages-on-Strava). Chrome picks the right one automatically based on the user's browser language; missing keys fall back to English (`default_locale`).

Every non-English locale carries the full toolbar / status string set, not just `extensionName` + `extensionDescription`. If `chrome.i18n.getMessage` is unavailable at runtime for any reason (a known edge case with MV3 content scripts loaded via dynamic import), the typed `t()` helper in `src/i18n.ts` falls back to a baked-in English copy of every string, so the toolbar still renders rather than throwing.

**The non-English translations are machine-quality starting points, not professional translations.** They follow correct grammar and pick reasonable register, but a native speaker will likely find phrases that are slightly awkward or non-idiomatic for the domain (athletic tracking). If you speak one of these languages natively, a PR replacing the questionable phrasing is very welcome - flag the specific message key and explain why your wording reads better.

## Adding a new locale

1. Pick the right [Chrome locale code](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n#locales) (underscores, not hyphens - `pt_BR`, not `pt-BR`).
2. Copy `_locales/en/messages.json` to `_locales/<code>/messages.json`.
3. Translate each `message` value. Leave keys, `placeholders`, and `description` fields alone - those are not user-facing. The `$NAME$` tokens inside messages must stay verbatim; they get replaced at runtime with values like photo counts and ids.
4. Test in Chrome: change your browser language (chrome://settings/languages → move your locale to the top), reload the extension, visit Strava's My Activities page, confirm the toolbar shows your translation.
5. Add a row to the table above and open a PR.

If a string is missing from a locale's `messages.json`, Chrome falls back to the default locale (English), so it's safe to ship partial translations or drop a key while a translation is being rewritten.

## Conventions

- **Sentence case**, not Title Case, for buttons and labels - matches both Strava and Chrome extension conventions.
- **Keep `Ko-fi` as a proper noun.** It is not translatable.
- **HTTP errors stay in English.** The `$REASON$` placeholder in `savedWithSkips` and `downloadFailed` carries values like `HTTP 404` or `Network error` that we surface verbatim - don't translate the surrounding text in a way that breaks if the reason is English.
- **Ellipses** in progress messages (`…`) should be the typographic single-character ellipsis, not three dots. Most translation tools handle this automatically.
